      <h1>Juggler's Ghost In February</h1>
      <img src="images/JugglerinApril.jpg" alt="rough etching in black on brown showing abstract figures and shapes" />
      <p>The following p5 sketch is based on Paul Klee's Bauhaus era etching <em>Gaukler im April</em> which translates to Juggler in April. I've named my sketch <em>Juggler's Ghost in February</em> because the background is in constant movement while the skeleton-like stick figure is able to float around the screen slowly using the arrow keys.</p> 
      <p>I chose to gain inspiration from this piece because as I was looking through the art gallery, my eye kept coming back to it. I was attracted to the rough free form drawing. The etching looks as if bits and peices are drawn on top of others like juggling distracted and unrelated thoughts.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, execution in the p5 canvas couldn't capture the expressions as freely, but I did get a chance to play around with a lot of basic scripting concepts like loops, rotation, and homemade functions. The greatest technical difficulty was trying to get the sun's rays to rotate, and the greatest creative difficulty was trying to give the sketch more...sketch and less precision.</p>
