                        <p>As a small project for myself, I built a simple blog template. The goal of this project was to become more comfortable with rapid builds of a few hours. The design colors, fonts, and layout are based on a similar look I saw online. I used Brackets as my text editor and the UIKit framework. The imagery is stock. This project gave me confidence and helped me to realize how quickly I could develop something beautiful and useful.</p>

                        </a>
                        <p>In a final project for class, I was challenged to build a front-end framework from the ground up using HTML and CSS/SASS. The goal of this project was to learn more about how frameworks work and to create something basic, responsive, and using SCSS syntax and CSS variables. I designed, developed, and wrote all the content for this project. I used Brackets as my text editor and Scout as my compiler. I had a lot of fun with this project and learned so much. Looking back, I might have made the colors more nuetral and added more components.</p>

                        <p>I was approached by the business operations team with a request to create UI mock ups of new marketing strategies. The goal of the project was to have a set of about 50 images showing how the website could look if certain ideas were implemented. I tackled this project alone, but used a design system library that had already been established by the brand. I met with the team regularly to flesh out ideas, even contributing my own, and then translated those ideas into mock ups and prototypes using Sketch, Principle, and Origami Studio. My mock ups were shared in presentations with research teams, executives, and vendor partners like Nike and adidas. Those presentations resulted in conversations, green lights, and funding. Looking back at this project, I wish the operations team had planned ahead of time with the user research team and that there was more communication and open discussion with the design systems team.</p>

                        <p>In a project for class, I was challenged to practice layouts and micro-animations by developing a small website. I designed, developed, and wrote all content using HTML, CSS, and the Brackets text editor. (No framework) Images are stock from Unsplash. Through this project, I learned a lot about layouts and how to create a commonly requested look. In retrospective, I wish I had spent more time on the animations. </p>

                           In a final project for class, I was challenged to build an application using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> library. My goal was to learn more about how to use the HTML5 canvas element and get creative. I designed, developed, and wrote all content using HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the Brackets text editor. The background image and sound is stock. This project showed me how creative javascript could be by introducing a processing script. It was a lot of fun!! I loved working on this! My only regret is that I wish I had spent a little more time with the UI Design.

                            In a final project for class, I was challenged to utilize all of the major concepts we had learned during the semester. I designed, developed, and wrote all content using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, PHP, Handlebars, and the Skeleton framework. Images are screenshots from the game. This project was an excellant opportunity to dive into many tools and skills that were new to me.

                            Eastbay was in the process of re-branding. The goal of this project was to give both the designers and developers more flexible color options to choose from so that the brand would be better equipt to meet the needs of the modern consumer. I was on a team of 4 designers that decided the color scheme using brains, research, and photoshop. I also put together this presentation PDF afterward. This color set is now in use on <a href="https://www.eastbay.com/">eastbay.com</a> and in its printed look book. This was a great team and our meetings were always full of purpose.

I helped the client decide how to visually present the brand and created this logo using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Fonts were free for commercial use. Looking back, I could have spent more time on the edges and creating mock ups to help the client visualize the end product more.

                <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Amelia Ruzek. I'm a designer, developer, and student of Digital Media Design <a href="https://twitter.com/harvardext?lang=en">@HarvardEXT</a>.</p>
                <p>I became interested in design after learning animation and drawing in high school. In college, I continued to develop my design skills and became increasingly interested in computer programming as well. After college, I worked on a team of about a dozen graphic designers for the Foot Locker, Inc. website, <a href="https://www.eastbay.com/">eastbay.com</a>. At Eastbay, I built a stronger brand by co-directing various marketing campaigns and photo shoots in addition to visually designing web, social, and email marketing graphics and animations on a daily basis. I continually developed my team by actively sharing web and user interface research, coaching my teammates one on one with various design and technology processes, and presenting concepts for marketing innovation. In addition, I strengthened relationships with internal executives and vendor partners such as Nike by providing Eastbay's business operations team with high fidelity user interface designs and prototypes presenting the company's future innovations and plans for the website. </p>
                <p>In June of 2018, I earned a graduate certificate in Front-End Web Development from the Harvard University Extension School. I am continuing in that discipline as a graduate student in Digital Media Design while freelancing and writing educational articles as time allows.</p>
                <p>In a few years, I hope to be in a career that bridges the gap between design and technology.</p>
